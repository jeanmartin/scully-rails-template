# This is an example of how to setup AASM for a model called Story

require 'aasm'
class Story < ActiveRecord::Base
  
  include AASM
  
  aasm_column :state
  
  aasm_initial_state :pending
  
  aasm_state :pending
  aasm_state :approved
  aasm_state :denied

  aasm_event :approve do
    transitions :to => :approved, :from => [:pending, :denied]
  end

  aasm_event :deny do
    transitions :to => :denied, :from => [:pending, :approved]
  end
  
  def approved
    @approved = true
  end
  
  def recently_approved?
    @approved
  end
  
end

# In the Stories controller.....

class StoriesController < ApplicationController
  
  # Normal RESTful methods go here (e.g. index, show, edit, etc.)
  
  def approve
    @story = Story.find(params[:id])
    @story.approved #reference method in model to set recently_approved?
    @story.approve!
    flash[:notice] = "Story has been approved!"
    redirect_to('/stories')
  end

  def deny
    @story = Story.find(params[:id])
    @story.deny!
    flash[:error] = "Story has been denied!"
    redirect_to('/stories')
  end
  
end

# In routes.rb........

map.approve "/stories/approve/:id", :controller => 'stories', :action => "approve"
map.deny "/stories/deny/:id", :controller => 'stories', :action => "deny"
