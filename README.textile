h3.  What's setup

When the template is generated, the following occurs:
* All the above plugins and gems are installed and vendored.
* User Session is generated
* User Sessions Controller is generated
* User model and database migration is generated
* Users controller is generated
* Formtastic generator is run
* Baseline app structure is generated
** application_controller.rb specifics
** environment.rb configuration
** Capistrano envrionment-specific recipes are installed
** Actionmailer initializer created as action_mailer_configs.rb with Gmail settings
** smtp_tls.rb created for use with Gmail and ActionMailer
** Misc initializers are created
** Basic routes are installed in routes.rb

At the end of the generation, the base views, models, and controllers for AuthLogic as well as admin and application layouts are installed as follows:

<pre><code>
  |____app
  | |____controllers
  | | |____user_sessions_controller.rb
  | | |____users_controller.rb
  | |____models
  | | |____user.rb
  | |____views
  | | |____layouts
  | | | |_____admin_nav.html.haml
  | | | |_____flashes.html.haml
  | | | |_____user_bar.html.haml
  | | | |____admin.html.haml
  | | | |____application.html.haml
  | | |____user_sessions
  | | | |____new.html.haml
  | | |____users
  | | | |_____form.html.haml
  | | | |_____secondary_nav.html.haml
  | | | |____edit.html.haml
  | | | |____index.html.haml
  | | | |____new.html.haml
  | | | |____show.html.haml
  |____public
  | |____javascripts
  | | |____validatious.min.js
  | |____stylesheets
  | | |____reset.css
</code></pre>

For a little extra helps with AASM (which I always need to reference), there is a text file called AASM.txt that merely provides and example of how to use AASM in the model.

h3.  How to use

To use this template, run the following command:

<pre><code>
  rails -d mysql -m http://github.com/scullygroup/scully-rails-template/raw/master/scullyonrails.rb /path/to/app/appname
</code></pre>
